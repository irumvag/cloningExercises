## Css Trial Challenge
 
This was homepage writing challenge using HTML and CSS.

As a trial website cloning challenge today you will clone this page `[demo]https://www.fewo-direkt.de/. (Ignore the QR-code pop-up and ignore the cookie-banner). 

Focus on the desktop breakpoint, but try to get as much built-in responsiveness as possible. If you have enough time, try to get the mobile breakpoint done properly as well.

you will only clone the home page, no functionalities, no subpages. The menu needs to be there but clicking it doesn't need to do anything.
ignore all animations
if you have time, try to implement the sticky header.
If something is difficult for you - leave it for last. Don't waste time on it in the beginning.
Prioritize the things where you will make the fastest progress.
